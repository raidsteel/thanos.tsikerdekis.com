  bio         : "I work as a Post-doctoral research at SRONâ€™s Earth group. My research focuses on atmospheric aerosol particles, bridging the gap between satelite and model estimate using an ensemble based data assimilation technique. My work aims to develop a data assimilation system for top-down estimates of aersol emissions based on multi-angle photopolarimetric aerosol retrieval of POLDER/PARASOL."
